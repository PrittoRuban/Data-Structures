Quick Sort Algorithm
The program must accept an array of N integers as the input.
The program must sort the N integers using Quick Sort algorithm.
It must print the state of the array whenever a swap occurs by selecting the first element as the pivot in the quick sort algorithm.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 20
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^5
Example Input/Output 1:
Input: 6 35 73 39 71 98 15
Output: 15 73 39 71 98 35
    15 35 39 71 98 73
    15 35 39 71 73 98
Example Input/Output 2:
Input: 5 40 50 10 20 30
Output: 30 50 10 20 40
    30 20 10 50 40
    30 20 10 40 50
Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs
